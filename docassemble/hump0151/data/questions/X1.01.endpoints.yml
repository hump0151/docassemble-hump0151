# LHS template for written contract not being necessary

template: JJHwritten_contract_template
content: |
  **You do not need to write your contract down to prove you have a contract.**

  Many people think they don't have a contract because they never signed anything.
  However, the law doesn't work that way.  If you and someone else:

  - promised to do some work; and
  - promised to pay for that work

  then you most likely have a contract, even though you never wrote anything down.

  A written contract helps to work out exactly what those promises were, but 
  it's not required in order for there to be a contract.  A written contract
  is evidence of what you promised, but it's not required to prove the
  promises ever existed.

  Based on your responses,

  You should seek legal advice.  Collect any evidence about the 
  contract that you might have, such as text messages, phone call logs,
  diary entries and so-on.

  Based on your responses, you **may not be able to sue** for 
  breach of contract.

  You should still seek legal advice for a formal legal opinion.

  Based on your responses:
  
  % if JJHcertainty != 'JJHagree_exact':
  - You and the other person did not agree to do this work, or all of this work,
    or there was other work done that was not agreed to.
  % endif

  - You never reached a firm agreement on how much to pay for the work done.

  - The other person was under 18.  It is possible in some circumstances to enter into
    a contract with people under 18.  You should seek legal advice about whether your
    situation meets these circumstances.
  % endif


  In order for there to be a contract, you need to prove these things:

  - That you and the other person agreed to the work to be done.
  - That you and the other person agreed to how much you would pay for the work.
  - That you and the other person are able to enter into a contract.  Usually this means you
    both should be over 18 years old.  You need to seek legal advice if one or both of
    you is under 18.
